You have a linked list and want to find the kth to last node
Write a function kth_to_last_node() that takes an integer k and the head_node of a linked list, and returns the kth to last node in the list

Restate the problem
  Missing question
  - ask if its a singly linked list or doubly linked list

Sample inputs and outputs
  S1 think 0, 1 - think small
  S2 Break it
    what if k is negative (through an error if k is negative)
    last node is k = 0
    0       k = 0
    0       k = 1
    0 1 2   k = 1 - return is 1
    0 1 2   k = 2 - return is 0
    0 1 2   k is negative, raise errors
      if k is greater than the length - 1

english approaches

go through the full list, track the items you are going through in an array, if the array length - 1 is greater than or equal to shift a ff the front before pushing the new one in

go through the full list generating a hash map of them with indexes, and return the length - kth index

analyze
  linear time, constant spaces
  linker time, linear spaces
  2x + linear time

Pseudo code
run k through the break cases first
get the length(count) of the nodes
then

RUBY
def kth_to_last_node(node, k)
  arrow1 = node
  arrow2 = node

  k.times do
    arrow1 = arrow1.next
  end

  until arrow1.next == NULL
    arrow1 = arrow1.next
    arrow2 = arrow2.next
  end

  return arrow2 (implicitly return in ruby)
end

JAVASCRIPT
function kthToLastNode(node, k) {
  let arrow1 = node;
  let arrow2 = node;

  for (i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    arrow1 = next(arrow1)
  }

  while (next(arrow1) !== NULL) {
    arrow1 = next(arrow1);
    arrow2 = next(arrow2);
  }

  return arrow2;
}




Imposter Syndrome - During Interview
1. Admit what you don't know
2. By demonstrating what you do know
  Your circle of knowledge is expanding, by admitting what you don't know but you have an idea and demonstrating how you will reach out for that and expand
3. Make a comfortable physical space
